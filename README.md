# Forecasting Net Prophet - MercadoLibre

## Background
Prophet is a valuable tool that is an open-source library developed by Facebook for time series forecasting.
It is designed to handle the complexities of time series data, such as trends, seasonality, and holidays, making it easier for users to create accurate forecasts. We'll be using Prophet to do a times series analysis of the company, MercadoLibre. [MercadoLibre](http://investor.mercadolibre.com/about-us) is an e-commerce site with over 200 million users and is the most popular e-commerce site in Latin America.

## Overview
In this python notebook, we'll pretend to be a growth analyst at MercadoLibre. We'll go step-by-step analyzing the company's financial and user data to make suggestions on how the company could grow. We'll explore the ability to predict search traffic can translate into the ability to successfully trade the stock.

## Methodology

Following is a summary of all the steps well take to explore, investigate and make valuable insights on the data:

Step 1: Find Unusual Patterns in Hourly Google Search Traffic
Step 2: Mine the Search Traffic Data for Seasonality
Step 3: Relate the Search Traffic to Stock Price Patterns
Step 4: Create a Time Series Model with Prophet

## Future Work

In this analysis, we compared the stock price data against search trends. Other variables like total sales can also be investigated along side search trends. It would be interesting to add in over variables to see how search trends correlate.
